# Building the Front End

We have already prepared a basic User Interface for our Smart Contract, using the [Truffle React box](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes/react).

```
npm install
npm run start
```

If you have Metamask, you will be prompted to login to Metamask.
After doing that, select the network `localhost:8545`. **This is the local network where we are running our local blockchain**

> *Note*:
> 
> If you get vulnerabilities warnings after running `npm install`, you can
> run `npm audit fix` to solve fix the issues.
