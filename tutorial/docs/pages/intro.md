# Introduction

Building a Dapp on Ethereum brings a lot of challenges to application developers. These include understanding blockchain fundamentals, smart contract languages, deploying, testing your contracts, and finally connecting your application to the blockchain via an API.

In the development world of Ethereum, a smart contract acts as the back-end logic of an application. A mobile or web application, would be how the users would interact with your product/service.

> But how do both front-end and backend  communicate between each others?

There is where Web3.js comes into play.

## What is Web3


> Web3 is more a vision around the Ethereum protocol, and the next phase of the web: web3.0
> * Web 1.0 = original World Wide Web
> * Web 2.0 = Web hosted applications and services, communicating via HTTP protocol
> * Web 3.0 = decentralized web, powered by Blockchains and DLT

Web3.js is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node, using a HTTP or IPC connection.

## How web3 communicates with the Ethereum blockchain

Your Dapp is simply a user-interface, written with a front-end framework of your choice (React, Angular, Webpack, Ionic, Vue...).

Technically, web3 contains different modules that are JSON-RPC objects. These are roughly equivalent to JSON in the way they are passed between the front end (your application) and the back-end (a node or smart contract) of an Ethereum-powered application.
