install the Web3.js library (https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/ JavaScript-API#adding-web3) as described in the last section, to try out some
of the ethereum JavaScript api calls. these include checking a balance, sending
a transaction, creating an account, and all sorts of other mathematical and blockchain-related functions. if your etherbase private key is held on your machine, for example, you can get the balance by typing in the console:
   eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase).toNumber();
hopefully by now, you have a working understanding of mining, and youâ€™ve see it happen before your own eyes. in reality, the most effective way to see how mining moves state transition forward, executing contracts, is to work with the testnet.
